        "question": "What exactly does it mean that you are a \"Technology Architect\"?",
        "answer": "It means I design, integrate, and optimize complete systems: infrastructure, networks, servers, hardware, AI automation, security, and web platforms. I don't work on isolated pieces; I build the complete technological ecosystem that supports a modern digital business."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does hiring a Technology Architect benefit me instead of several specialists?",
        "answer": "You don't need a programmer, a sysadmin, an automation specialist, and a security technician separately. I cover all these areas in an integrated way, ensuring coherence, stability, and efficiency. You save costs, reduce friction, and get a functional system from start to finish."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you analyze my current infrastructure and propose real improvements?",
        "answer": "Yes. I perform technical audits where I evaluate performance, security, configurations, compatibility, automations, hardware, networks, and deployments. I identify bottlenecks and deliver a clear strategic plan based on professional technical criteria."

      {
        "question": "Can you design the complete technological infrastructure of my company?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you also offer DevOps or SysOps services?",
        "answer": "Yes, with a practical approach adapted to small and medium-sized businesses. I configure environments, pipelines, secure deployments, VPS, basic containers, monitoring, and technical automations, without the unnecessary complexity of enterprise environments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change my entire technological environment even if you don't know how it's currently built?",
        "answer": "Yes. I have experience auditing and rebuilding legacy, hybrid, obsolete, or poorly integrated systems. I can migrate, modernize, and stabilize them without interrupting your operation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer advice on equipment purchases or technological renewal of a company?",
        "answer": "Yes. I evaluate real needs, desired performance, compatibility, durability, and scalability. My approach avoids impulsive purchases or bad investments, ensuring that the chosen hardware performs and has a prolonged useful life."
      },
      {
        "question": "What level of security can you implement in my systems?",
        "answer": "I apply practical technical security: server hardening, secure configuration, basic network segmentation, web best practices, attack vector review, operational shields, and monitoring. Realistic and effective security for SMEs and professionals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What type of projects can you complete fully and turnkey?",
        "answer": "– Modern corporate web\n– VPS + deployment + security\n– AI automation\n– Hybrid systems (local + cloud)\n– Networks and cameras\n– Infrastructure for digital businesses\n– Audits and environment modernization\n– Comprehensive support and maintenance"
